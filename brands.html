So here we are, on the verge of content and commerce. Whatever perspective you acquire, integrating content into commerce (and the other way around) is easier said than done. Product has to be worthy, content has to be authentic, and the transaction experience — a bridge between publishing and retail — must be seamless.

    There are two words that we all live and swear by in the dot-com era: content and commerce. And indeed, content has now become the biggest slice in the global e-commerce pie, where nearly every established retailer suddenly has a story to tell, a picture to share, and a video to show.<br>
    But despite the fact that content and commerce have been co-existing for quite a while, content commerce has never, until now, existed as a concept in itself. In fact, if you go to Google Keywords and type in “content commerce”, you will see that there are only 260 monthly searches for the term.<br>
    The irony here is that content commerce is already a $44 BLN worth industry and it has been in existence for years — just in a "strictly undefined” form. Depending on the perspective, this ambiguous trend can be perceived as content-driven commerce or commerce-driven content. And while they may sound quite similar at first glance, the difference between them is actually enormous.<br>
