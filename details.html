    Promises of hassle-free delivery and easy payment options are making festivities more rewarding. However, don't get blinded by the excitement. Read the fine print carefully to sweeten your deal further.
    It's truly getting exciting this festive season with Apple's new iPhones topping the charts, closely followed by Samsung's curved ultraHD TV and the convertible laptops from Lenovo, among a host of other new launches and great deals across categories. But, there's more to the fun and frolic as it is raining discounts from e-commerce giants such as Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon. Besides, promises of quick and hassle-free delivery, easy payment options and no-questions-asked refund and return policies are only making the festivities a lot more rewarding. However, don't get blinded by the excitement. Read the fine print carefully and compare the prices across portals to sweeten your deal further.

<h2>Some products often claim free delivery over a minimum order of Rs 499</h2>
<p>
    The thumb rule of online shopping is to cross-check prices of products that you wish to buy across various e-commerce websites. There are possibilities that even the maximum retail price of branded as well as unbranded products might be different, and you might end up buying a product at a price far higher than the maximum retail price.
</p><br><br>

<h2>Inflated Price/Discounts</h2>
<p>
    You should never go by the percentage of discount offered on any e-commerce site as these are calculated on the maximum retail price and not on the market operating price. The market operating price of gadgets is usually lower than the MRP. For instance, the maximum retail price of Samsung Galaxy S 6 was Rs 49,900 at the time of the launch, while the current market operating price is Rs 36,900. Some websites have listed the price as Rs 49,900 and the discounted price as Rs 36,900, which isn't actually true.

<h2>Warranty</h2>
<p>
    While shopping for a product, you should always check the warranty details. There are chances that the products might belong to the grey market and instead of the manufacturer, it is the seller offering warranty on the products. In such a scenario, if something goes wrong, the product will not be repaired by the company's authorised service centres. Chances are that even the seller might refuse to repair the product at a later date.

<h2>Seller Review</h2>

<p>
    We don't stock the product and sell it directly. Instead, they list the products from various sellers and closely monitor the order till the time it is delivered. Therefore, it is important to check the seller's rating and reviews, which are based on user experiences and feedback on their purchases. This helps in understanding how good the particular seller is in meeting client expectations. You should prefer a seller with a higher rating over the one with a lower rating. In some cases, sellers do offer a better discount or price, but take longer to ship the product or may even send you a used product.

<h1>Always check the exchange or return policy of a product before buying it during festive sales</h1><br><br>
<img src="./img/details image3.jpg">
<p>
    The biggest advantage of shopping online is not about the comfort of ordering and receiving a product, but the ease of returning and refund that e-commerce players offer. But, this may not be the case during festive sales. Always check the exchange or return policy of a product before buying it during a festive sale. If it highlights an exchange offer in case of a faulty product, all you will get is a replacement and not a refund. Says Jayant Sood, Chief Customer Experience Officer, Snapdeal: "We do business as usual during the festive sales. Our standard policies on refund and return apply throughout the year so that our customers are never inconvenienced. We recently launched the instant refund facility. This will help customers get refunds within one hour of receiving the returned product. Snapdeal is the first to introduce an automated, API-based, real-time, highly reliable, secure instant refund transfer system based on IMPS technology with one of largest private banks of India."
